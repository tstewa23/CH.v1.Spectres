# CH.v1.Spectres

You are an anthropologist researching cryptids. You've heard myths about this house: the creatures in it and relics as well.

Click to move. You can only move in straight linesâ€”either horizontally or vertically, not diagonally.

Chests contain relics. Reach a chest to collect its relic and gain its power.

The rest is an adventure. Enjoy
